Today we made our first iteration of the chicken sandwich. The ingredients included an artisan bun, sauce, chicken thighs, pickles, and la lot leaves.

The pickles were a quick pickle, seasoned with dill, garlic, salt and pepper.

Then we seasoned the chicken thighs with salt and pepper. We fired up the smoker with hickory chips and set a timer for one hour at around 275 degrees.

In the meantime we prepared the sauce. It was a mixture of pork liver paté, miso, kewpie mayonaise, lemon, and sriracha.

After the hour passed, we took the smoked thighs and dredged them in buttermilk and flour. The buttermilk was seasoned with salt and pepper. And the flour was seasoned with salt, pepper, paprika, and garlic salt.

Once we had the chicken dredged, we heated some canola oil and got ready to deep fry. Since the thighs were 95% cooked, the deep fry took no more than 2 minutes to reach a perfect golden brown consistency. We also deep fried the la lot leaves for later.

To assemble, bottom bun down with sauce. Then comes the quick pickled pickles for crunch. On top of the the smoked fried chicken thigh. Afterwards, we placed the deep fried la lot leaves for more crispiness. And finally finished the top bun with more sauce and that's it.

It was delicious, but could use some improvement. The chicken needs more spice and flare. The sauce doesn't hold up on it's own. And the la lot leaves, unfortunately, were far too oily to be enjoyable.

Action items:

- Try to marinade the chicken before smoking for 24 hours. We could revisit the lalot leaves at this point, possibly blend them into the marinade.
- Scrape the paté and replace it with another umami profile, maybe fish sauce. Also consider yuzu in the sauce.
- Consider a new leafy green or get rid of it entirely.
- Think about the end goal bun. Japanese milk bun?
